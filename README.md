## Project Description
This was my Folder Assignment for the source "Game Engine Architecture".
<br>
<br>
With the use of C# I built a Neural Network to be used in "Unity Engine" for making a "car" learning its way through a track.
I made the movement and steering using physic towards left, right and forward force.
Each car performs 5 raycasts to check for nearby collisions (walls).
The AI teaches the cars to move away from collisions and towards open areas by tweaking the weights in the Neural Networks' feedforward and backpropagation algorithms.
